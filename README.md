# auto1111-clockwork
Just the auto1111 stable diffusion repo with a few merged pull requests for my own use e.g. advanced hiresfix options to allow using a different sampler and step count for the initial generation, and the option to discard next-to-last sigma.

Also includes my config options and saved styles so you probably don't want to use this if you're not me (or delete config.json and styles.csv if for some reason you do)
