# auto1111-clockwork
Just the auto1111 stable diffusion repo with a few merged pull requests for my own use e.g. advanced hiresfix options, option to discard last sigma. Also includes my config options and saved styles so you probably don't want to use this if you're not me (or delete config.json and styles.csv)
